/// The PeerConnection class is the entry point to most of WebRTC.
/// It encapsulates a single connection between a local peer and a remote peer,
/// and hosts some critical events for signaling and video rendering.
///
/// The high level flow to establish a connection is as follow:
/// - Create a peer connection object from a factory with
/// PeerConnection::create().
/// - Register a custom callback to the various signaling events.
/// - Optionally add audio/video/data tracks. These can also be added after the
/// connection is established, but see remark below.
/// - Create a peer connection offer, or wait for the remote peer to send an
/// offer, and respond with an answer.
///
/// At any point, before or after the connection is initated (CreateOffer() or
/// CreateAnswer()) or established (RegisterConnectedCallback()), some audio,
/// video, and data tracks can be added to it, with the following notable
/// remarks and restrictions:
/// - Data tracks use the DTLS/SCTP protocol and are encrypted; this requires a
/// handshake to exchange encryption secrets. This exchange is only performed
/// during the initial connection handshake if at least one data track is
/// present. As a consequence, at least one data track needs to be added before
/// calling CreateOffer() or CreateAnswer() if the application ever need to use
/// data channels. Otherwise trying to add a data channel after that initial
/// handshake will always fail.
/// - Adding and removing any kind of tracks after the connection has been
/// initiated result in a RenegotiationNeeded event to perform a new track
/// negotitation, which requires signaling to be working. Therefore it is
/// recommended when this is known in advance to add tracks before starting to
/// establish a connection, to perform the first handshake with the correct
/// tracks offer/answer right away.
